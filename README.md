# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
Capstone project for IBM data science certification through Coursera

The Capstone Notebook is simply an upload test as this is the first commit I have ever made to a github repository using git bash on my local PC. 
Disregard it for any other purposes.

The Segmenting and Clustering Neighbourhoods in Toronto, Canada is my first attempt at a simple datascience project using K-means clustering. 
The data was obtained from a wikipedia page using beautiful soup to parse the HTMl page and then import a pandas dataframe. 
The data was then wrangled and cleaned for application of the K-means clustering algorithm.
